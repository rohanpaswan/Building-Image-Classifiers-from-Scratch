# Building-Image-Classifiers-from-Scratch
This project aims to build and compare different deep learning models for classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We will explore the impact of increasing model complexity, from a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to more sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), on performance and efficiency.
